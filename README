XML/DocStats version 0.01
=============================

XML::DocStats parses an xml document using a SAX handler built
using Ken MacLeod's XML::Parser::PerlSAX. It produces a listing
indented to show the element heirarchy, and collects counts of
various xml components along the way. A summary of the counts is
produced following the conclusion of the parse. This is useful to
visualize the structure and content of an XML document.
